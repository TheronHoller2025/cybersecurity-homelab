A note on folder organization:
The homelab/ directory covers network and infrastructure builds — routers, VMs, topology, and device configuration. The hardening/ directory covers OS-level security hardening on individual machines, such as Lynis audits and system lockdown procedures. Some overlap exists by nature (e.g. router hardening lives in homelab/ because it is primarily an infrastructure build), but the distinction keeps infrastructure work separate from host-level security work. This structure may be consolidated in a future revision.
